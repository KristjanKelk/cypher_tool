Cypher Tool

The Cypher Tool is a simple command-line utility that allows you to perform various text encryption and decryption operations. It provides three different cypher methods:

ROT13 Encryption/Decryption: This method rotates each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet. It's a simple letter substitution that's easily reversible.

Reverse Alphabet Encryption/Decryption: This method reverses the letters of the alphabet in the input text. It's a basic letter reversal operation.

Custom Encryption/Decryption: This method combines the reverse alphabet and ROT13 encryption methods. First, it reverses the alphabet, and then it applies ROT13 encryption on the reversed text.

Usage
To use the Cypher Tool, follow these steps:

Run the program.
Select the operation (Encrypt or Decrypt) by entering 1 or 2.
Select the cypher method (ROT13, Reverse, or CustomCipher) by entering 1, 2, or 3.
Enter the text message you want to encrypt or decrypt, including spaces.

The Cypher Tool will perform the selected operation and display the result.

Getting Started
To run the Cypher Tool, you need Go installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the cypher_tool.go file with Go.


go run cypher_tool.go
